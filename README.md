# Neuro_network
A LSTM net to automatically produce text. This project was initially used to generate swearing, especially malicious swearings. However, I as traumatized while dealing with training data set, so I repleace the data set with some essays written by senior student. I hope this work can be used morally.

This work was supported by WenXin, an LLM by BaiDu, and it is an imitation of a work on 51CTO blog, the original coding can be seen on https://blog.51cto.com/u_16175432/6919768. My work is just a minor bug fix and adaptaion on MPS of his, so thanks very much for his support and code.
